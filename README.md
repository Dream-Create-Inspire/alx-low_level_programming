# Low-Level Programming

Low-level programming involves writing code that operates at a level close to the hardware. Here are some key points:

1. **Level of Abstraction**:
   - Low-level languages provide minimal abstraction from the computer's hardware.
   - Programmers working with these languages deal with memory management, registers, and hardware-specific details explicitly.
   - These languages map closely to the processor instructions and are often either machine code or assembly language.

2. **Examples of Low-Level Languages**:
   - **C** and **C++** are commonly used low-level programming languages.
   - They allow fine-grained control over memory and hardware resources.
   - In low-level programming, you work directly with concepts like pointers, memory addresses, and bit manipulation.
